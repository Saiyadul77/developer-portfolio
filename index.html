            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Md. Saiyadul Amin Akhand. Nick name Sayed. I'm from Cumilla and currently live in Boardbazar,
                Gazipur. There are nine members in my family including me. I have completed my Bsc in CSE and MBA(HRM)
                in 2014
                and 2019 respectively. My strength is hard work, never giving up being flexible to learn new things. My
                weakness is that I easily trust anyone. I like to spend my free time reading books, learning something
                new and innovative that enhance my knowledge and skill. My short-term goal is to get a job in a well
                reputed company like yours and my long-term goal is to gain work experience and knowledge to contribute
                to the growth of the company. </p>
            <p>That's all about me.</p>
